Available for Windows, MAC OS X, and various Linux distributions, the ownCloud
Sync client is a desktop program installed on your computer. The client enables
you to:

- Specify one or more directories on your computer that you want to synchronize
  to the ownCloud server.
- Always have the latest files synchronized, wherever they are located.

Changes made to any synchronized file on the computer are automatically made to
the files on the ownCloud server using the sync client.
